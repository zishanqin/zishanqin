### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a programmer who is committed to becoming an all-round researcher. Some fun facts about me:
- I enjoy programming in C++ and Python, and can also code in Java, Haskell, Ada, Assembly and so on. 
- Before starting my first degree in CS, I studied Pharmaceutics, with lots of chemistry and physics involved.
- During my undergraduate studies, I took ML & AI & TCS as my specializations, and mathematics as my minor.
- My research interests primarily lie in 3D vision, but I had worked on a variety of projects in other areas.
- I am always open to working on interesting research projects, in collaboration with people.
- Besides research, I also enjoy tutoring computer science courses, with extensive relavant experience at ANU.
