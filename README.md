### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a PhD student at UNSW. Some facts about me:
- I enjoy programming in C++ and Python (with a background in competitive programming), and am also proficient in Java, Haskell, Ada, Assembly, and other languages.
- Before pursuing computer science, I studied Pharmaceutics, where I was exposed to a substantial amount of chemistry and physics.
- During my undergraduate studies, I specialized in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Theoretical Computer Science, with a minor in Mathematics.
- I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at ANU ahead of schedule, without relying on external credits, and graduated as the fastest student in each program.
- My primary research interests lie in 3D vision, though I have worked on a variety of projects across different areas.
- Beyond research, I enjoy tutoring computer science courses and have extensive teaching experience from my time at ANU.
- Outside academia, Iâ€™m passionate about sportsâ€”especially bouldering (indoor climbing) and snowboarding.
